# CrimsonLog
`Server side only` mod for a questing system in V Rising

This is a rather simple mod. It includes logging of all the available chats (including whisper and team chats). 

All of it is confiruable what you want to log and if you want the logs seperated into different files. 

Logging of non-chat systems will come soon.
